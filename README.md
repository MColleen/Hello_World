# Hello_World
My first repository

Hello all. This is my first Git Hub repository. Just testing things out. Here are some things about me.

I am looking for a job in IT. I love 🤖 AI and 🎮 Game Dev. I have found my passion in programming but am quite skilled at the more "boring" organizational stuff like SOPs and proposals. I have project management skills as well. I would like to grow my programming skills exponentially.

I have many interests like 💻, 📚, 🎮, 🎲, ✍️, and 🎵. 

Enjoy my repository.
